# SimpleRenderEngine

This is an update to Morten Nobel-Jørgensen's SimpleRenderEngine (sre). The intent of the updates is to enhance the capabilities and to make the SRE interface easier to use (e.g. not as dependent on advanced C++11/14 features like Lambdas) and with less exposure of OpenGL internals (e.g. by abstracting away direct use of transformation matrices).

Two new cameras (derived from the basic virtual camera) have been added:
1) A basic "First-Person Surveyor (FPS)" (e.g. a Minecraft-like) camera (demonstrated in `examples/18_FPS-camera.cpp`)
2) A basic "Flight" camera (demonstrated in `examples/19_Flight-camera.cpp`)

The goal of SimpleRenderEngine is to provide easy way to get started with graphics programming in 2D or 3D without a deep knowledge about the low-level graphics APIs like OpenGL, DirectX and Vulkan.
 
SimpleRenderEngine currently depends on Simple Direct Layer 2.x (SDL2), SDL2-image, OpenGL Mathematics (GLM), and OpenGL 3.3 (or higher), Dear ImGui and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
 
sre provides:
 * First-Person Surveyor (e.g. Minecraft-like) virtual camera
 * Flight virtual camera
 * Basic virtual camera (perspective and orthographic)
 * Texture support (JPEG, PNG)
 * Cube map support
 * Mesh support (with custom vertex attributes)
 * Shaders (PBR, Blinn-Phong, unlit, alpha blending, and custom shaders)
 * Enforces efficient use of OpenGL
 * Forward rendering
 * Full C++14 support
 * Support for 2D or 3D rendering
 * GUI rendering (using Dear ImGui)
 * Emscripten support (allows cross compiling to HTML 5 + WebGL)
 * VR support (OpenVR)
 * Bump mapping
 * Shadowmap

To keep sre as simple and flexible as possible the following features are not a part of sre:
 * Scenegraphs
 * Deferred rendering
 * Dynamic particle systems

## Build Instructions

### Ubuntu Linux

Use the Ubuntu 'Software Updater' utility to ensure Ubuntu is fully up-to-date. Then take these steps:

    sudo apt full-upgrade
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt autoremove

Install compilers and build tools (if not installed already):

    sudo apt install g++
    sudo apt install git
    sudo apt install make
    sudo apt install cmake
    sudo apt install cmake-curses-gui # This is optional

Install libraries (if not installed already):

    sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
    sudo apt install libsdl2-image-dev
    sudo apt install libglew-dev

### Windows

SRE is fully supported using the MSYS2 "Linux-like" environment. It is possible to build SRE with Microsoft Visual Studio, but several warnings have not been addressed and several manual steps need to be taken inside Visual Studio to build successfully.

#### Install MSYS2 and Packages

Go to the MSYS2 site <https://www.msys2.org/> and follow instructions to install MSYS2 and mingw64.
        
Open 'MSYS2 MinGW64 64-bit' command line from 'MSYS2 64bit' folder in the
Windows Start Menu and then run:

    pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain # Install compilers and tools
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glew  # Install GLEW
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake # Install CMake
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-qt6   # Install CMake gui (not keeping qt in-sync with CMake can lead to "error while loading shared libs")

The cmake executables are:

    /mingw64/bin/cmake.exe
    /mingw64/bin/cmake-gui.exe

Install SDL2:

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_image

#### Notes on Using the MSYS2 Package Manager

To see which packages are needed to make a package work properly, use

    packman -Qi package_name [e.g. mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake]

To search for a package available in MSYS2, use the command

    pacman -Ss package_name

To search for an already-installed package, use the command

    pacman -Qs package_name [or part of a package name]


### MacOS

TODO: Add MacOS instructions


### Install sre (all platforms)
 
Go to the directory that you want to install SRE into and clone the repository:

    cd [directory-to-install-into] 
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/estrac/SimpleRenderEngine.git sre

In the above command, `sre` is the installation directory that will be created for SRE. Note that if you have forked the repository you should replace `estrac` with your username.

Go to the installation directory:

    cd sre

If you have forked the repository, run the following to stay in-sync:

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/estrac/SimpleRenderEngine.git

Use the `pwd` command to get the full-path-of-install-directory used below

    pwd

The `-p` flag gracefully handles a pre-existing directory

    mkdir -p ../sreBuild

Go to the build directory and run CMake:

    cd ../sreBuild
    cmake [full-path-of-install-directory]

or for developers who want to build a Debug version and run tests:

    cmake [install-dir] -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DINSTALL_GTEST=ON -DUSE_SRE_TEST_AND_UTILS:BOOL=ON

Finally, build SRE and run the examples

    make
    cd examples
    ./SRE-Example-00_hello-engine

## Tests

Tests can be built by selecting `USE_SRE_TEST_AND_UTILS` in CMake and are located in the `test` folder. Tests are automatically run (nightly, after checkin, and after a pull request) using GitHub Actions with the `cmake.yml` file in `.github/workflows`. They can run manually from the build directory by using the following command

    ctest --output-on-failure

## Examples
 
Examples (in the `examples` folder).
